Filters

The new filter system adds support for filtering on selected fields.

The Buffer Search dialog will display a multiselect listbox containing all available fields for the current buffer, provided that there are 2 or more fields to choose from.

Even if a buffer only supports a single field, it should still do the behaviors outlined below for consistancy if new fields are added in the future.  This will also assist in adding new fields since you won't have to add the extra required logic.

For buffers that support different fields depending on which post is selected, return all possible available fields from GetAvailableFields, and for posts that don't support a given field, do not return a value for it from GetFieldContent.

A buffer that can be filtered must not return any more information than is requested by the filter buffer.

All buffers that support filters must provide 2 methods to be called by the filter system.

GetAvailableFields(self)

This method takes no arguments other than self and returns a dictionary containing the fields that are supported for filtering.

The keys of the dictionary represent the strings that will be given to the GetFilterContent method, and the values are the strings that will be shown in the listbox in the filter dialog, so use the convention for localized strings for the values.

GetFieldContent(self, post, fields=[])

The GetFieldContent method takes 2 arguments other than self and returns a tuple representing the content of the requested fields.

The post argument represents the post that the buffer needs to return the field content for.

The fields argument is a list containing the fields for which the content is requested.  An empty list should be treated as if all available fields have been requested.  The strings in the fields list correspond to the keys of the dictionary returned by GetAvailableFields().

For an example of a buffer that supports filtering on multiple fields, see src/buffers/twitter/main.py.

For an example of a buffer that only supports a single field for filtering see src/buffers/twitter/trends.py.

For an example of a buffer that supports different fields for filtering depending which post is selected see src/buffers/twitter/sent.py.
