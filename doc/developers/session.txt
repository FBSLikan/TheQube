What is a session?
A session is an application internal to Qwitter which lives in the src/session directory.  It is comprised of a session class which is built from the various mixins which are already provided.  You can, of course, also add more useful parent session classes.  A session also (generally) requires configuration data which is provided in the session.defaults file located in the folder with the rest of the session.  The configuration session will automatically load all configuration data of all parents to a session.
Using session storage:on any descendant of the Storage session, you can use the .storage dictionary as a persistent storage mechanism for any data that need to be preserved.  The configuration session already utilizes this, so that any values set in the session's .config dictionary are saved in-storage.  It is necessary that when you change default options or other data which are already embedded in deployed session files that you write a migration to insure global compatibility.
