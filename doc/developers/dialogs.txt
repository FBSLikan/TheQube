If you want to build a simple dialog and you don't have vision/want to piddle about with trying to get wxPython sizes right, use the QwitterDialog class which is available in the dialogs package.  It is fairly-well documented, but general usage is to instantiate it with a parent, id, and title , add any controls you want to as is done in for instance the Solona Solution dialog, and then call self.finish_setup, optionally setting either create_buttons or set_focus to False.  If neither of these self-expressively named options are explicitly set false, the dialog will sprout ok/cancel buttons and set focus to the first control which is not a label.
